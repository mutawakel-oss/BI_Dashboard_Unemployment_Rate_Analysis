# The impact of Unemployment Rate on 14 European Countries GDP Growth

# 1	Introduction
High unemployment rate is generally correlated with a negative growth for some economies` GDP (Andresen, 2015). Therefore, this project explores the impact of the unemployment rates of the following 14 European countries on the growth of their GDP between 2000-2019:
1.	Poland
2.	Netherlands
3.	Finland
4.	Sweden
5.	Norway
6.	Germany
7.	France
8.	Switzerland
9.	United Kingdom
10.	Portugal
11.	Italy
12.	Spain
13.	Hungary
14.	Romania
A subset of above mentioned 14 countries represents east Europe which includes: (Hungary, Poland, Romania) and the remaining European countries are from other sides of Europe. This is because he economy of east European countries is lower than the economy in other European countries such as western European countries which can help to study the impact of unemployment rates in different economies.
