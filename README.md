# The impact of Unemployment Rate on 14 European Countries GDP Growth
In this project I have worked as a BI Developer.
# 1-	Introduction
High unemployment rate is generally correlated with a negative growth for some economies` GDP (Andresen, 2015). Therefore, this project explores the impact of the unemployment rates of the following 14 European countries on the growth of their GDP between 2000-2019:
1.	Poland
2.	Netherlands
3.	Finland
4.	Sweden
5.	Norway
6.	Germany
7.	France
8.	Switzerland
9.	United Kingdom
10.	Portugal
11.	Italy
12.	Spain
13.	Hungary
14.	Romania

A subset of above mentioned 14 countries represents east Europe which includes: (Hungary, Poland, Romania) and the remaining European countries are from other sides of Europe. This is because he economy of east European countries is lower than the economy in other European countries such as western European countries which can help to study the impact of unemployment rates in different economies.

Following is a screenshot of created Tableau dashboard where the values of correlation for each country across the 20 years has been added as a color filter to make it easy visually to spot countries with strong correlation. A good example for this is Hungary which has the strongest negative correlation (-0.64), and Norway which has the highest positive correlation (+0.29):

# 2-	Conclusions
High unemployment rate is usually correlated with a negative growth for some economies` GDP (Andresen, 2015). Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop the understanding for the impact of the unemployment rates on GDP growth of 14 European countries between 2000 and 2019. All the objectives of this research were met as follows:
1.	First objective was to research the academic literature related to the state of art in the design of interactive dashboards. The background research of the first part in this report (Part 1: Dashboard Design) has helped to apply a critical literature review in a coherent way for that. It started by discussing the importance of visualizing data, then it discussed the different stages required to visualize data starting by considering the main objective of visualization and the visualization reasons. This was elaborated by conducting an argument between two reason categorization models. Furthermore, a suggested evaluation metric was discussed (S. Stoltzman, 2018). Moreover, different types of dashboards were reviewed along with the best practices in designing their information architecture. Finally, some recommended practices in designing dashboard were discussed. On the other hand, the Background Research section of this second part (Part 2: Statistical Analysis) has provided a detailed literature review for the selected approaches of each statistical analysis section includes: descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis and comparative analysis.
2.	Second objective was to explore the dataset, pre-process it, and derive the requested statistical analysis measures (descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis, comparative analysis). All these analysis activities were conducted with detailed analysis and discussion in this second part of this report section 4 (Part 2: Statistical Analysis).
3.	Third objective was to develop a single screen dashboard to visualize the data and applied analysis. This objective was met by designing the workflow of the dashboard and the best visual components which resulted in building a one-single screen dashboard along with a data story under the section of modelling. For more information, kindly check section 4 of the first part of this report (Part 1: Dashboard Design). 

4.	Fourth objective was to critically evaluate the applied approaches and form proposal which was covered under the evaluation stage of CRISP-DM process method stage section 5 (Part 1: Dashboard Design). Furthermore, a critical evaluation of the applied approaches used in the statistical analysis part of this project was included in section 5 (Part 2: Statistical Analysis).
To sum up, all the three determined objectives of this research have been met effectively.
